# NaiveBayes
Classifier: A classifier is a machine learning model that is used to discriminate different objects based on certain features.

A Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model thatâ€™s used for classification task. The Bayes theorem serves as the foundation of the classifier.

Bayes Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A)P(A))/P(B)
Using Bayes theorem, we can find the probability of A happening, given that B has occurred. Here, B is the evidence and A is the hypothesis. The assumption made here is that the predictors/features are independent. That is presence of one particular feature does not affect the other. Hence it is called naive.
